                    <p>Deciding on a university to go to and a degree to study isn’t always easy. There are so many universities and degree choices, you might feel overwhelmed! Reading in a good public university is most of the student’s dream. Some students don’t have an option. Studying at a private university can be very expensive. Some can’t afford that. So, some students don’t have an option. They must study at a public university so that they can complete their graduation. There is a very limited amount of seat available in public universities. Every year after passing their HSC exam student fight for every single seat. Whoever gets the opportunity, they are treated very special and respected in our society. Three Bangladeshi universities have managed to secure their position in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2022, with only Dhaka University among top 1,000 universities of the world.

                    <p>The emergence of private universities was prompted by several factors of which two are most important. (1) The demand for higher education increased much faster than the public university system could cope with; and (2) scarcity of public fund and other resources i.e. the government could not mobilise the required infrastructures, and financial and human resources to match the rapidly increasing demand. With continuous widening of the gap between the supply of and demand for higher education the private entrepreneurs, philanthropists and social leaders found new opportunities to serve the society by establishing private universities. On the other hand, the government realised that without public-private partnership the rapidly increasing demand for higher education could not be met. A private university can be a great value because of the individualized attention students receive. The resources private institutions allow for better aid to students, better degree programs and more opportunities. If you want to get admit yourself in the private university of Bangladesh, then this ranking factor will help you to get admission in right university. At present, most rankings depend on the combination of various indicators like covering research, teaching quality, admission process, employment rate after study and so forth. These indicators are thus weighted and standardized to the final overall score. North South University's Business &amp; Management Studies and Computer Science &amp; Information Systems has been ranked in the QS World University Rankings 2021 by Subject for the second year in a row.  North South University (NSU) has proudly held its undisputed spot as the #1 private university in Bangladesh in the latest QS World University Rankings - Asia 2021.

Independent University, Bangladesh (IUB) has also made its’ position in the Scimago Rankings 2021.</p>
